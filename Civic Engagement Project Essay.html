		<h1>Freddie's take on whether the use of the Internet be monitored, regulated, and if so, by whom and to what extent?</h1>

			<p> The Internet has become an essential component of daily life in the digital age, impacting everything from business to communication. However, its wide and uncontrolled reach also brings with it serious drawbacks, such as cybercrime, false information, and privacy violations. The necessity of Internet monitoring and regulation, possible oversight bodies, and the reach of such restrictions are all examined below. The open nature of the Internet encourages creativity and the right to free speech, but it also provides an environment that is conducive to negative behaviors. A proactive strategy for online safety is required due to the rising sophistication of cybersecurity threats, including phishing attempts and data breaches. According to a Symantec analysis, cybercrime damages are expected to cost the world $6 trillion yearly by 2021, underscoring the urgent need for immediate and effective cybersecurity measures(Smith, 2020.)

			<p> Additionally, the widespread distribution of false information on digital platforms seriously negatively affects democracy, public health, and security in the real world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization highlighted the risks associated with the so-called "infodemic," in which misinformation has hampered public health initiatives. This can ultimately harm the information to the less informed public, such as the elderly, who have a harder time distinguishing between false and true sources(WHO, 2020.)

			<p>Narrowing down the scope and identity of Internet regulation requires negotiating difficult legal and moral dilemmas. Governments are responsible for protecting the welfare and security of their citizens on a national level. Many nations have established laws to protect consumer data and privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. GDPR is one of the strictest privacy and security laws in the world. It imposes stringent data protection requirements for companies, governments, and other entities that process the data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. Under GDPR, consent for data processing must be clear and freely given, making opt-in consent necessary in many cases. GDPR also grants individuals a high degree of control over their data, including rights to access, correct, delete their data, and transfer it to another service provider(EU Commission, 2018.) These laws serve as a framework for how companies should handle personal information, providing a model for others to follow.

			<p>Nevertheless, because the Internet is worldwide, national laws are insufficient on their own. Not only is international cooperation advantageous, but it is essential. Organizations such as the United Nations may be essential in promoting international norms and collaboration in the field of Internet governance. Not only is this cooperative approach beneficial, but it is also essential for managing cross-border problems like cybercrime and data privacy.

			<p>Regulation is obviously necessary, but figuring out how much of it is appropriate is a fine balance. Overregulation may hinder creativity and violate free speech, two fundamental aspects of the Internet's culture. As a result, laws ought to be made as little an intrusion as possible while still being powerful enough to handle serious threats. One strategy is to prioritize accountability and transparency over content restriction. For example, in order to prevent the propagation of false information, social media companies may be required to reveal the algorithms they use to promote content. Moreover, strong data security and protection methods can defend against online dangers without compromising the Internet's functionality.

			<p>The Internet is a worldwide resource that fosters innovation and communication; therefore governing it effectively is necessary to maintain its open character while mitigating the hazards that come with it. To create rules that are minimally intrusive, equitable, and effective, national governments and international organizations must work together. A safer and more dependable digital environment can be promoted by emphasizing accountability, openness, and international cooperation. It is essential that all parties involved—businesses, governments, and civil society organizations—cooperate to set the direction of Internet governance going ahead. To maximize the advantages of the Internet while minimizing its drawbacks and ensuring that it continues to be a positive force in the world community.
